// We are defining a template for instance called contentView that is a view.
struct ContentView: View {
  
  // Now, we have one computed property called 'body'.
  // This is the definition of a variable named body and it's a some view.
  //Means 'body' can contains either a view or something like which behaves as a view.
  
  
  // This is a state variable which maintains the user interface of our app
  // Whenever the value of state variable changes, swiftUI automatically
  // recalculates the body property and re-renders the view.
  
  // User Interface ans state should be connected or synced.
  
//  User Interface ans state should be connected or synced.
//  SwiftUI is defined to solve the problem of the mismatch between  the user interface and application state

//  Term know as Binding - is the fancy way of saying that a particular user interface view will always be tied to a particular state value.
  
  // In this we'll make a binding between the state variable and the slider value.
  // By doing this, everytime we move the slider, the state variable automatically changes to match and vice verca
  // If we update the state variable, the UI of slider changes in accordance to the state variable value. (Means they are bound together)
  
  
  // option + cmd + P  = to resume the preview.
  @State private var isAlertVisible: Bool = false
  @State private var sliderValue: Double = 20.0
  //We'll make binding with this state variable.
